<h2>Application style guide</h2>
<p>
  Hannover Re uses a reduced and unpretentious design which gives the user rapid guidance and facilitates recognition.
  The aim is to achieve the greatest possible visual uniformity for all digital interfaces.
  Applying clear design principles also serves to improve usability.
</p>

<p>This style guide concerns all screen-based media, such as</p>
<ul>
  <li>software products marketed externally to customers</li>
  <li>home-made or licensed software products for in-house use</li>
  <li>online tools and web-based services for in-house use</li>
</ul>

<h2> Fonts</h2>
<p>The font ‘Compatil’ is used in all applications of Hannover Re. If ‘Compatil’ is not available or too costly (e.g. for only internally used applications) the
  free font ‘Source’ is used. To use the fonts, please get in touch with Corporate Communications.

  The Bootstrap Theme comes with the ‘Source‘ font included.

  Please use the fonts as described in the style guide.
</p>


<h2>Icons</h2>
